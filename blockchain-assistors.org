  + [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcNg9KsXuMc][Hashing in Blockchain]]
+ Titles to Research
  + Cryptography Basics:  You will reseach the basics of cryptography, including encryption, decryption, and hashing. You will also learn about symmetric and asymmetric key algorithms.
  + Hash Functions:  You will reseach about hash functions and how they are used in blockchain technology. Hash functions are cryptographic algorithms that convert any input data of arbitrary size into a fixed-size output. They are used to ensure the integrity of data on the blockchain.
  + Hashing in Blockchain:  You will reseach about the specific hash functions used in blockchain technology, such as SHA-256 and Keccak-256. These functions are used to generate a unique digital fingerprint of each block on the blockchain, which is critical to maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.
  + Merkle Trees:  You will reseach about Merkle trees and how they are used in blockchain technology to efficiently store and verify the integrity of large sets of data. Merkle trees are a type of data structure that allow for efficient verification of the authenticity of data in large datasets.
  + Key Management:  You will reseach about the importance of key management in blockchain technology, including private and public keys, digital signatures, and key management best practices.
  + Zero-Knowledge Proofs:  You will reseach about zero-knowledge proofs, which are cryptographic protocols that enable one party to prove to another party that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the statement itself. Zero-knowledge proofs are used in blockchain technology to enable privacy-preserving transactions.

  + [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319157822002919][Deep about PBFT]]
+ Titles to research
  + What is a Consensus Algorithm:  You will reseach what a consensus algorithm is and why it is necessary for blockchain technology. A consensus algorithm is a process used to achieve agreement among a network of nodes on the state of the blockchain.
  + Proof of Work (PoW):  You will reseach about the most well-known consensus algorithm, Proof of Work (PoW), which is used by the Bitcoin blockchain. PoW requires nodes on the network to perform complex computational puzzles to add a new block to the blockchain.
  + Proof of Stake (PoS):  You will reseach about Proof of Stake (PoS), a newer consensus algorithm used by blockchains such as Ethereum. PoS requires nodes to stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency to participate in the consensus process.
  + Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):  You will reseach about Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), a consensus algorithm used by blockchains such as EOS. DPoS involves electing a small group of nodes to validate transactions and create new blocks on the blockchain.
  + Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT):  You will reseach about Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), a consensus algorithm used by some enterprise blockchains. PBFT requires nodes to communicate with each other to validate transactions and reach consensus on the state of the blockchain.
  + Other Consensus Algorithms: You will also learn about other consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Authority (PoA) and Hybrid Consensus, which combine elements of different consensus algorithms.
  + Consensus Algorithm Trade-offs:  You will reseach about the trade-offs between different consensus algorithms, such as security, scalability, energy efficiency, and decentralization. You will also learn about the implications of choosing a particular consensus algorithm for the blockchain's functionality and user experience.
